# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2025-12-29

This Privacy Policy describes how **[Home Hero]** ("we", "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the **Home Hero** mobile application (the "App") and related services (collectively, the "Services").

If you have questions, contact us at **[support@yourdomain.com]**.

## 1) Information We Collect

### A. Information you provide
- **Account information:** name, email address, password (stored as a secure hash), and optional phone number and location you provide.
- **Profile information:** information you add to your profile (e.g., provider details, categories).
- **User content:** messages you send through the App, and files you choose to upload (for example, photos/videos attached to messages).
- **Support communications:** information you provide when you contact support.

### B. Information collected automatically
- **Device and usage data:** basic device identifiers and diagnostic/log information (such as device type, OS version, app version, timestamps, and network information) to operate and secure the Services.
- **Approximate location (optional):** if you enter a location in your profile or job postings, we store that value.

### C. Payments and subscriptions
If you purchase subscriptions or other paid features, payments may be processed by a third-party payment processor (for example, **Stripe**). We do **not** store your full payment card details; they are handled by the payment processor.

### D. Advertising
The App may show banner advertisements (for example, using **Google AdMob / Google Mobile Ads**). Ad providers may collect or receive device identifiers and ad interaction data to serve and measure ads.

---

## 2) How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Provide, operate, and maintain the Services (including account creation, job browsing/posting, bidding, and messaging).
- Process transactions and manage subscriptions.
- Enable file uploads and display attachments you send.
- Improve the Services, troubleshoot issues, and monitor performance.
- Prevent fraud, abuse, and enforce our terms.
- Communicate with you about your account, service updates, and support requests.

---

## 3) How We Share Information
We may share information:

- **With other users as part of the Services.** For example, your name/profile and messages/attachments are shared with the person you are communicating with.
- **With service providers** who help us operate the Services (for example: hosting providers, database providers, email providers, crash/error monitoring, payment processors like Stripe, and advertising providers like Google AdMob). They may process information on our behalf under contractual restrictions.
- **For legal and safety reasons** when we believe disclosure is required by law, regulation, legal process, or to protect rights, safety, and security.
- **In business transfers** (e.g., merger, acquisition) where information may be transferred as part of the transaction.

We do not sell your personal information in the traditional sense. (Some ad providers may use data for interest-based advertising as described below.)

---

## 4) Advertising Choices
Depending on your device and region, you may have choices to limit ad tracking or reset advertising identifiers:
- **Android:** Settings → Privacy → Ads (varies by Android version)
- **iOS:** Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking

Note: Disabling ad personalization may not stop ads, but can affect how they are targeted.

---

## 5) Data Retention
We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Services and for legitimate business purposes (such as security, compliance, and dispute resolution). For example:
- Account data is retained while your account is active.
- Messages and attachments may be retained to provide conversation history and support moderation, security, or legal requirements.

You may request deletion of your account as described below.

---

## 6) Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. No system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 7) Your Rights and Choices
Depending on where you live, you may have rights to:
- Access, correct, or delete certain information.
- Object to or restrict certain processing.
- Request a copy of your data.

To make a request, contact **[support@yourdomain.com]**. We may need to verify your identity.

---

## 8) Children’s Privacy
The Services are not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## 9) International Transfers
If you use the Services outside the country where our servers are located, your information may be transferred and processed in other countries.

---

## 10) Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above and may provide additional notice in the App.
